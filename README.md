# Functional programming in Scala

## Summary

In recent roles I've been asked to put together some presentations to
introduce functional programming concepts. I usually recommend the
Paul Chiusana and Runar Bjarnason book. However, it can help to
briefly introduce the concepts required.

The presentation is for developers new to Scala, but may have completed the EPFL Scala courses.
It is not intended as an introduction.

This presentation is a work in progress. I need to acknowledge references, 
as I've collated material e.g. blog posts, websites to form the presentation examples.

May be useful to anyone that has to help bootstrap Scala adoption within their team.

Probably a few errors.

I would appreciate any corrections or suggestions.
